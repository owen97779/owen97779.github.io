# About

Welcome to my blog. This is where I update my thoughts, ideas, plans and projects that I am working on. I hope you enjoy reading my blog as much as I enjoy writing it. 

Currently, the blog is quite bare, there is much to fill and much to do. In terms of projects, I have completed a few and need to write them up on the blog to showcase them. I also have a few projects that I am working on and will be writing about them as I progress. 

I therefore have the opportunity to write about the theory behind the electronic engineering projects that I am working on, with the aim of formulating all that I have learnt in a codensed "handbook" that people, without a formal background in EE (like myself), can understand.

Furthermore, I want to write about my experiences, life living on this planet and how best I can serve humanity. We all have a part to play and I know I can provide value in spreading virtue, wealth and a peaceful existence for all. I write from a position of humility, on top of the shoulders of giants that have come before, with love for my fellow man. I hope everything I write will be that which I apply in my own life, practicing what I preach you may say, and I hope to build a community that shares my love for humanity and the pursuit of virtue.

I'm trying to work on my writing style, keeping it as concise but as descriptive as possible, bear with me. If you like what you read, maybe you have a comment or suggestion to make, [contact me](#contact-me). Hopefully, I can get a comment system working on this blog.
